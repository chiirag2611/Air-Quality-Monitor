# Air-Quality-Monitor
Air quality monitor using Smart Sensor Network Systems


Enclosed spaces in different areas are not equipped with the essential resources and information to track air quality result- ing in lower efficiency and concentration time in youngsters.

Our method seeks to offer a practical and affordable system that permits real-time air quality parameters level measurement and analysis, enabling proactive decision-making to sustain the best possible air quality in closed spaces. Our approach uses a simple architecture and wireless technology to provide a seam- less connection between the air quality sensors such as SCD41, SCD30 and CCS81, allowing for low-power and almost real- time transmission of data. The asynchronous database applica- tion, which is queue-based and scalable, facilitates the efficient gathering, storage, and analysis of information. This results in clear understanding of air quality parameters levels and allows fast responses to any alarming trends.
